README - NOTICE OF FRAUDULENT CONSTRUCT & OPEN TIMESTAMP PROOF

This folder contains two important files related to the legal declaration titled
"NOTICE OF FRAUDULENT CONSTRUCT â€“ LEGAL NAME FRAUD AND LAWFUL REPUDIATION":

1. NOTICE_OF_FRAUDULENT_CONSTRUCT.txt
   - This is the original declaration document authored by William Kingsley Johnson.
   - It contains the full legal notice of repudiation and statement of non-consent.

2. NOTICE_OF_FRAUDULENT_CONSTRUCT.txt.ots
   - This is the OpenTimestamps (OTS) cryptographic proof file.
   - It serves as an immutable timestamp recorded on the blockchain.
   - The OTS file proves that the original document existed in its exact form at the time of stamping.
   - This proof is based on the SHA256 hash of the original document.

Important Notes:
- The .ots file is a separate file and must be kept together with the original document.
- Do NOT modify either file, as any changes will invalidate the timestamp proof.
- To verify the timestamp in the future, use the original document along with this .ots file
  on the OpenTimestamps Verify tool or compatible software.
- Embedding the .ots proof inside the document is NOT possible without breaking the proof.
- This separation is by design for cryptographic integrity and legal reliability.

Verification Resources:
- Official OpenTimestamps website: https://opentimestamps.org
- Stamp your document: https://stamper.opentimestamps.org
- Verify your document and proof: https://verifier.opentimestamps.org

By keeping these files together and unaltered, you ensure your lawful claim is securely timestamped and verifiable.
